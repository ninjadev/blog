Suggesting that Sporcle will increase learning is a controversial statement. If anything, it does nothing but increase your trivia skills, which - in itself - is nothing to brag about. This is a narrowminded way of thinking, and I subscribe to the idea that anything you do, contribute to learning.

## What does this have to do with Sprocle?
Sporcle is a site where you primarily take a lot of quizzes. The topics are many, and the quizzes are more. You will learn a lot about stuff you didn't know, and a lot about stuff you don't need. While a lot of the content is user submitted, Sporcle has some "Sprocle approved" content, where certain standards are met. There is also user moderation, and with the amount of hardcore Sproclers, most content is very good.

Take a lot of quizzes. You will always encounter new questions you didn't know beforehand, and thus expanding your knowledge. There is also a fun part to this, as you can challenge your friends, and there is multiple high score lists all over. These range from person, to university and beyond (?).

## But quizzes doesn't make you learn
I can understand why people would say that quizzes doesn't provide any real learning, and I have to somewhat agree to this. That being said, I would like to emphasize that I am not saying this will in any way, shape or form be an alternative to studying. The way I want people to use Sporcle is as an alternative to just lurking on the internet, or just playing some mindless flash game that no one cares about. 

Why I would encourage Sporcle instead of some other mindless game is because it stimulates the brain somewhat. Even if a lot of the games is just guessing, you will read the answers afterwards, and thus obtain new knowledge. Even better: when you actually believe you know something, you will spend some time trying to figure it out, and this is gold. The idea here is that whilst doing something fun, you will exercise your brain by having a problem to solve. I admit if the problem is "list the states in USA" it's not so giving, but memorization is a vital key to a productive brain. Given the wide array of topics, you can always learn something new.

## Too long, didn't read
So what I want to emphasize in this blog post, is that as long as your brain is working in some way, you will enhance your learning. Whether it's some mental exercises, or just some memorization tasks. This will ultimately help your learning, and do this without having a bad time.

Try Sporcle, and have fun!
