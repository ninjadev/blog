ingress: Ninjadev released their second proper demo last week at Solskogen 2013. Follow the trials and tribulations of a new demo group figuring out what's what in demo making in what can only be a new and innovative approach of radical, impactful transparency which provides a brutally honest glimpse into the undertakings of a loosely coupled hacker`s collective in the demoscene. Or something like that. Anyway, here is what we learned during the making of TUNL-MNTN-WTER.

# TUNL-MNTN-WTER: a peek behind the scenes

Some intro text about the scene, and solskogen.

## Why begin now when you can begin later?

Time management is a fickle mistress, and although we knew [for the longest time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_XgQhMPeEQ#t=32) that we wanted to make a demo for Solskogen 2013, actually getting started is really hard.
As it turns out, people have lives, and finding time for demo making is not always the easiest task.
Work on TUNL-MNTN-WTER started a small week before Solskogen, with most of the work put during the first evening/night of the party.
Of course, doing to much demo coding at a party means missing out on a good deal of partying, so lesson learned.
Funnily, this is the exact same lesson that we learned last year with our first demo [HONEYCOMB](link-to-the-pouet-prod-page-here) at last year's Solskogen, but next year will be different!

## Choosing a language/framework

Our first demo was a JavaScript-powered web demo using WebGL with [THREE.js](http://threejs.org), and we wanted to do something different this time around.
We spent ages mucking about with different combinations of c, c++, opengl, lightweight framework x, heavyweight framework y, but eventually gave up.
A hard requirement for us is decent cross-platform compatibility, because we all develop in wildly different environments, ranging from Windows 8 through OS X Mavericks to Arch Linux, and most things inbetween.
Even getting simple C++/opengl snippets to run reliably on the different platforms was prohibitively hard (how do you guys do it, people who have managed it?!), so in the end, with the compo deadline looming nearer and nearer, we settled on making a JavaScript-powered web demo using WebGL with THREE.js.

## The music

A long time ago, an idea for a demo featuring trains started floating around in our group.
Because the music was composed the weekend before a single line of code for the demo was written, the composers had an enormous amount of thematic control for the demo.
Inspired by Pat Metheny's "Last train home", the soundtrack for the demo was chugged out over the course of two days, in which the composers spent most of their time making appearances at Martini parties.
