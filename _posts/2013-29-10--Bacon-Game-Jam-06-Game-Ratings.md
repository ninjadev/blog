# Reviewing Games from Bacon Game Jam 06

So, I have decided to play through every single game for Bacon Game Jam 06 and review them here!

First off, congratulations to everyone who completed a game during the jam.
Finishing a game in 48 hours is a major accomplishment, and you should all be proud of yourselves.

On the [Bacon Game Jam site](http://bacongamejam.org), the entries as listed in reverse order sorted by the number of ratings the game has been given so far.
This is the order that I am going to review the games in, more or less.

Now there are probably a lot of games I am not going to understand, or miss the point of entirely, so to the developers who read this and might feel snubbed: sorry about that.

First off is [Rainbow Drop](http://bacongamejam.org/jams/bacongamejam-06/143/) by elefantopia's team.
There are no instructions on the site, but I'm sure I can figure something out.

There's a Windows binary to download, which is nice.
It looks like a Unity game.
Starting the game, a cute-looking cloud, some flying umbrellas, and some hexagonal colored buckets are visible.
The clouds actually appear hand-drawn and scanned in, which I find impressive.
Clicking the mouse drops a colored droplet to the ground.

It seems like the aim of the game is to fill the hexagons with colored droplets from different clouds.
This turns out to be quite hard, because there is a lot of confusing vertical scrolling involved.
The more droplets you manage to land safely in a hexagon, the higher you will ascend, but it gets increadibly hard after a while.
In the end, the cloud I was controlling dissappeared when a dropped a droplet too close to the edge.


## [The Cave](http://bacongamejam.org/jams/bacongamejam-06/149/)

[The Cave](http://bacongamejam.org/jams/bacongamejam-06/149/) by balomus's team is a classic platformer game.
The aim of the game is to collect color gems hidden around in a cave to construct a rainbow.
The game was made using Gamemaker Studio.
Balomus writes that this is his first complete game, and I am impressed.
The levels are quite big, and the game mechanics are solid save for a few collision detection issues which semi-permanently glue the player to a wall.
Luckily, balomus has thoughtfully included a "fix key" (`F` on the keyboard) that helps remedy this somewhat by force-jiggling the player slightly on screen.

Suddenly, in level 2, music starts to play.
Why the game hasn't had music before now I do not know.
At any rate, the music is cool, and makes the game more enjoyable.

## [Rainbow_TrickotTreat](http://bacongamejam.org/jams/bacongamejam-06/154/)

[Rainbow_TrickotTreat](http://bacongamejam.org/jams/bacongamejam-06/154/) by SwingInnovations is another "collect the 7 colors of the rainbow" type game, of which there seem to be a fair amount of in this game jam.
This time, you have to collect colors by going trick or treat.

Trick-or-treating at a house will give you either a candy or a rainbow color.
You can visit the same house over and over again to farm massive amounts of candy if you want, as each house only has one rainbow color to give out.
Grabbing all the 7 colors of the rainbow ends the game and displays the amount of candy you have collected as a high-score.
This high-score is pretty easy to push to absurd heights by farming candy, as long as you have the patience.
Perhaps the point is to complete the game with as *little* candy as possible, sort of like golf?
That would at least make the game more challenging.

Technically, this game is pretty simple, and graphics-wise we are reunited with a staple of game jam player avatars: the square. The music is quite good, and although it is an externally sourced royalty free track, it still really sets a nice mood for the game.


## [Rainbow Serpent](http://bacongamejam.org/jams/bacongamejam-06/164/)

[Rainbow Serpent](http://bacongamejam.org/jams/bacongamejam-06/164/) by LionelJitro's team is a solid snake clone.
It features a cool Super Rainbow Mode which is activated every now and then which increases speed and makes you invincible for a short amount of time.
I haven't played a snake with invincibility before, so I though this was pretty neat when it happened the first time.
You quickly get used to it though, and the game goes back to feeling like a regular off-the-shel snake clone.

The graphics are oddly reminiscent of the covers of the O'Reilly series of programming books.
